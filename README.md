This was my final project for my Object Oriented Design class taught by Professor Naomi Bolotin in fall of 2023.

Instructions for running the game are as follows:

1. Clone repository on your local machine
2. From the cloned directory, run the command: javac -cp . builder/*.java command/*.java decorator/*.java observer/*.java factory/*.java
3. Then run the command: java builder.LabyrinthGame
4. The game is intuitive enough to figure out from there, your character is in the chamber marked with the “o” symbol and you want to progress through different corridors to other chambers, marked “#”, looking for the exit, marked “X”.

Detailed explanation of my thought process, design patterns used, and future improvements can be found in the final project write-up located, which can be foundin the repository as well.
